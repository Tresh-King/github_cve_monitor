      "description": "Microsoft  acknowledged a critical remote code execution  vulnerability (CVE â€“ 2020 - 1350) existing in  Windows Domain Name System (DNS) when it  fails to properly handle requests. An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T",
