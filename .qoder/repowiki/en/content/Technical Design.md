## Introduction

The github_cve_monitor is a Python-based monitoring application designed to automatically track and report on GitHub repositories containing CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers. The application serves as a lightweight yet functional solution for security researchers and organizations to stay informed about newly published vulnerability-related code on GitHub.

The system operates through a procedural programming paradigm with function-based organization, implementing several key architectural patterns including Singleton for database connections, Repository pattern for data persistence, Builder pattern for report generation, and Facade pattern for the main application interface. The application demonstrates a pragmatic approach to building monitoring tools with minimal dependencies and maximum usability.

## System Architecture Overview

The github_cve_monitor follows a straightforward pipeline architecture where data flows sequentially from external APIs through local storage to formatted reports. The system is designed around simplicity and reliability, prioritizing ease of deployment and maintenance over complex architectural features.

The architecture consists of four primary layers:

1. **External Systems Layer**: Interacts with GitHub API and GitHub Actions for automation
2. **Application Layer**: Contains the core business logic and orchestration
3. **Data Layer**: Manages persistent storage using SQLite and file-based reporting
4. **Output Layer**: Generates human-readable reports in Markdown format

## Core Components Analysis

### Database Management Component

The application implements a Singleton-like database connection pattern through the global `db` variable and `CVE_DB` model class. This design ensures consistent database access across all application functions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class CVE_DB {
+IntegerField id
+CharField full_name
+CharField description
+CharField url
+CharField created_at
+CharField cve
+Meta database
}
class DatabaseManager {
+SqliteDatabase db
+connect() bool
+create_tables() void
+select() QuerySet
+create() Model
}
CVE_DB --> DatabaseManager : "managed by"
DatabaseManager --> CVE_DB : "persists"
```

**Diagram sources**
- [main.py](file://main.py#L18-L30)
- [main.py](file://main.py#L32-L34)

The database schema is intentionally simple, focusing on essential fields for CVE tracking:
- `id`: Unique identifier from GitHub
- `full_name`: Repository name with owner
- `description`: Repository description with HTML escaping
- `url`: Direct link to the repository
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `cve`: Extracted CVE identifier

**Section sources**
- [main.py](file://main.py#L18-L30)

### API Integration Component

The `get_info` function serves as the primary interface to GitHub's API, implementing intelligent rate limiting and authentication handling. The function adapts its behavior based on the presence of a GitHub token, switching between authenticated and unauthenticated request modes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant App as Application
participant API as GitHub API
participant DB as Database
participant FS as File System
App->>API : GET /search/repositories
API-->>App : JSON response
App->>App : Parse CVE identifiers
App->>DB : Store parsed data
App->>FS : Write report files
App->>FS : Update daily index
```

**Diagram sources**
- [main.py](file://main.py#L120-L170)
- [main.py](file://main.py#L180-L220)

The API handler implements sophisticated rate limiting logic:
- Uses GitHub tokens to increase rate limits from 60 to 5000 requests per hour
- Implements random delays for unauthenticated requests to avoid hitting limits
- Handles pagination automatically through recursive API calls
- Provides comprehensive error handling and logging

**Section sources**
- [main.py](file://main.py#L120-L170)

### Report Generation Component

The report generation system utilizes a Builder pattern approach, with separate functions handling different types of reports. The system generates both daily and full reports in Markdown format, maintaining consistent structure and formatting.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
Start([Report Generation Start]) --> InitDaily[Initialize Daily Report]
InitDaily --> InitFull[Initialize Full Report]
InitFull --> CollectData[Collect Data from Database]
CollectData --> FilterToday{Filter Today's Data}
FilterToday --> |Has Today Data| WriteToday[Write Today's Records]
FilterToday --> |No Today Data| GetRecent[Get Recent Records]
GetRecent --> WriteToday
WriteToday --> WriteDaily[Write to Daily File]
WriteDaily --> WriteFull[Write to Full Report]
WriteFull --> UpdateIndex[Update Daily Index]
UpdateIndex --> End([Report Generation Complete])
```

## Architectural Patterns Implementation

### Singleton Pattern - Database Connection

The application implements a Singleton-like pattern for database management through the global `db` variable. While not a formal Singleton implementation, the design ensures that all database operations share the same connection instance.

```python
# Global database instance (Singleton-like)
db = SqliteDatabase("db/cve.sqlite")

# Model definition with shared database
class CVE_DB(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = db
```

This approach provides:
- Consistent database access across all functions
- Simplified connection management
- Reduced resource consumption
- Easy testing and mocking capabilities

### Repository Pattern - Data Persistence

The `CVE_DB` model class implements the Repository pattern, encapsulating data access logic and providing a clean interface for database operations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class CVE_DB_Repository {
+find_by_id(id) CVE_DB
+save(entity) void
+delete(entity) void
+query_by_cve(cve) CVE_DB[]
}
class CVE_DB {
+IntegerField id
+CharField full_name
+CharField description
+CharField url
+CharField created_at
+CharField cve
}
CVE_DB_Repository --> CVE_DB : "manages"
```

**Diagram sources**
- [main.py](file://main.py#L18-L30)

The Repository pattern benefits include:
- Separation of concerns between data access and business logic
- Encapsulation of database operations
- Simplified testing through abstraction
- Flexibility for future database migrations

### Builder Pattern - Report Generation

The report generation system employs a Builder pattern through specialized functions that construct different types of reports incrementally.

Key builder functions:
- `init_file()`: Initializes full report template
- `init_daily_file()`: Creates daily report structure
- `write_file()`: Appends content to reports
- `write_daily_file()`: Adds daily entries

### Facade Pattern - Main Application Interface

The `main()` function serves as a Facade, orchestrating all operations while hiding the complexity of underlying components.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class MainFacade {
+main() void
-init_file() void
-init_daily_file() string
-get_info(year) List
-db_match(items) List
-write_file(contents) void
-update_daily_index() void
}
class DatabaseLayer {
+CVE_DB Model
+connect() void
+create_tables() void
}
class APILayer {
+get_info(year) List
+handle_rate_limits() void
}
class ReportLayer {
+init_file() void
+write_file(contents) void
+update_daily_index() void
}
MainFacade --> DatabaseLayer : "uses"
MainFacade --> APILayer : "uses"
MainFacade --> ReportLayer : "uses"
```

## Data Flow and Pipeline

The application follows a linear data flow pipeline that processes GitHub API responses into structured reports:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph "Input Phase"
A[GitHub API Request] --> B[Rate Limit Check]
B --> C[API Response]
end
subgraph "Processing Phase"
C --> D[Parse JSON Response]
D --> E[Extract CVE Identifiers]
E --> F[HTML Escape Content]
F --> G[Store in Database]
end
subgraph "Output Phase"
G --> H[Generate Full Report]
G --> I[Generate Daily Report]
H --> J[Write Markdown Files]
I --> J
J --> K[Update Index Files]
end
subgraph "Storage Phase"
G --> L[(SQLite Database)]
J --> M[File System]
end
```

### Data Transformation Process

1. **API Data Collection**: The application queries GitHub's search API for repositories containing CVE identifiers
2. **Data Validation**: Raw API responses undergo validation and sanitization
3. **CVE Extraction**: Regular expressions identify and extract CVE identifiers from URLs and descriptions
4. **Content Processing**: HTML escaping prevents injection attacks and ensures proper Markdown rendering
5. **Database Storage**: Structured data is stored in SQLite with deduplication logic
6. **Report Generation**: Both historical and daily reports are generated in Markdown format
7. **File Organization**: Reports are organized in hierarchical directory structures
